# Liferay cluster in Docker

Project to quickly setup a Liferay EE cluster in Docker (two or more LR servers, NGinx reference server, mySQL). Stored for reference. Disclaimer:

- there is no LR software or licences in this repo
- I am no Docker expert, lots of what I do here can no doubt be done better and more efficiently
